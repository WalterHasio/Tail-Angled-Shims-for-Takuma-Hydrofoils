# Tail-Angled-Shims-for-Takuma-Hydrofoils
Tail shim for Takuma stabilizers.  Use the positive shims increase the angle of attack of the tail (more front foot pressure and more lift at higher speeds) and negative shims to decrease the angle of attack (more back foot pressure and less lift at higher speeds).
