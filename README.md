Tail shim for Takuma stabilizers.  Use the positive shims increase the angle of attack of the tail (more front foot pressure and more lift at higher speeds) and negative shims to decrease the angle of attack (more back foot pressure and less lift at higher speeds).
I usually try to adjust the tail angle so foot pressure is relatively constant across a wide range of speeds so I don't have to adjust foot position with speed, but it affects other factors like turning and takeoff so it's probably best to just try out different angles to see what feels right in the conditions you want to optimize for.

Some of the thicker shims may require longer screws.

Shims and Adapters
This is a list of various shims and adapters I've designed for foiling, most are available on Thingiverse, but a few are for sale.

Baseplate to Mast Angled Shim - Adjusts the angle of the board to the mast.  This does the same thing as a baseplate shim, but it goes inside the baseplate. Axis 19mm version

Baseplate to Mast Flat Shim - Fills the gap between the baseplate and the sides of the mast extrusion to make the system slighty more rigid. Axis 19mm version

Surf Elementals Mast Adapter - Adapter to use the more rigid 19mm Axis aluminum masts with Takuma foils. Axis 19mm Mast to Takuma Fuselage version

Mast to Fuselage Angled Shim - Adjusts the angle between the mast and the fuselage.  It's similar in function to a baseplate shim, but it goes inside the fuselage.  Takuma version - aluminum Takuma version - printable

Front Foil Flat Shims - Fills the gap in the front wing to fuselage joint.  This should help with issues like the wing coming loose and bolts breaking. (
